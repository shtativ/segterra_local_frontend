                <p>Humans are diurnal animals, meaning we work during the day, and sleep and restore (both physically and mentally) at night. But
                    things like technology, long work days, and even light bulbs have drastically expanded what we consider ‘waking hours’ compared
                    to those of our evolutionary ancestors. For most of history, when the sun went down, our bodies knew it was time for bed. But
                    now, most of us couldn't possibly imagine sacrificing those extra few hours between sunset and bedtime! </p>
                <p>So if we're not relying on light as a cue for day and night, what do we use? Well, the overwhelming answer is food! The first
                    bite or sip of anything other than water in the morning kicks your metabolism into gear for the day ahead. But recent research
                    shows that hacking this system by limiting how often we eat can improve multiple different facets of health. Here's how to
                    biohack your body clock.</p>
                <h4>R3 type style for subheadings</h4>
                <p>Because we're naturally fasting when we sleep, our bodies have evolved to associate the fasted state with
                    <a class="link link-primary" href="javascript:void(0)">biological repair.</a>
                    Intermittent Fasting (IF) is the concept of limiting how and when we eat, thereby keeping us in a restorative mode longer.
                </p>
                <p>IF comes in many forms. Most common is probably the
                    <a class="link link-primary" href="javascript:void(0)">time-restricted feeding (TRF)</a>
                    variation, in which all of someone’s calories are consumed in a relatively short window, typically 8 hours. This might not seem
                    restricting at first, but considering 50% of people eat their meals in a 15 hour time window on any given day, an 8 hour limit
                    will almost definitely require your eating habits to change.
                </p>
                <p>Another approach (not for the faint of heart) is
                    <a class="link link-primary" href="javascript:void(0)">prolonged fasting (PF)</a>
                    , in which a fasting period lasts 2 or more days with at least a week’s time of normal eating before the next round of fasting.
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, alternate-day fasting (ADF) lands somewhere between TRF and PF, as it's characterized by a two-day cycle of one fasting
                    day (consuming around 500 calories or less for an entire day) and one normal 'feeding day.' While the concept of any level of
                    fasting may seem difficult and, well, unnatural, research has shown IF has a positive impact on many different corners of the
                    health and wellness universe.</p>
                <h4>R3 type style for subheadings</h4>
                <h5>Weight loss</h5>
                <p>You might think that, if you were to limit the hours during which you can eat, you might get hangry and overcompensate for ‘lost
                    time’ come mealtime. But you’d be wrong! Evidence suggests that, if anything, IF results in lower calorie intake overall. And
                    even if you were to throw calorie restriction entirely out the window during “feeding” times, you may still see significant
                    weight loss; evidence shows TRF can help you lose weight, irrespective of calories.</p>
                <h5>Metabolic disease risk factors</h5>
                <p>As a general rule of thumb, chronic body clock dysregulation can increase your risk of metabolic disease (like diabetes, heart
                    disease, and high blood pressure). Luckily, many studies show that IF has a positive impact on multiple risk factors for these
                    diseases, including insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, appetite, markers of stress, and belly fat measurements.3,4 It’s
                    through these mechanisms that intermittent fasting can have significant beneficial effects on your glucose and lipid biomarker
                    levels.</p>
                <h5>Inflammation and immune response</h5>
                <p>If your white blood cell count is chronically high, TRF may help you return it to optimal.5 On the other hand, if your white
                    blood cell levels are low, a fasting routine can still help! PF has shown to kick stem cell growth into gear, thereby
                    replenishing the immune system with fresh, new cells.6 Giving your body an extra long rest from metabolizing food also gives
                    your digestive system a chance to relax and reset, which may help to lower levels of low-grade inflammation (like hsCRP levels)
                    in your gut.</p>
                <h5>Endurance levels</h5>
                <p>Feel like your endurance has hit a plateau? Incorporating IF into your routine may help to improve your performance and energy
                    efficiency.7 However, as noted above, IF may inherently come with reduced caloric intake, so make sure you’re still hitting your
                    training fueling needs and getting sufficient levels of endurance-related nutrients like sodium and potassium.</p>
                <h5>Healthy aging/longevity</h5>
                <p>n addition to accelerating the development of metabolic diseases, an off-kilter body clock can also accelerate the aging process
                    (ever noticed someone appear to age quickly after a few especially stressful and sleepless years?).2 Luckily, it seems that
                    fasting helps to reset your body clock and protect against these harmful effects. In fact, IF may directly protect DNA against
                    oxidative damage – a major contributor to the aging process.2 PF may also help to keep bones stronger for longer, as it can help
                    to slow bone mineral (like calcium) loss.8 So far, the evidence is only in mice, but this could be a good indicator that similar
                    results will be found in humans.</p>
